# Rhodes Island Tetralingual Voice Record Database
Or just TLVR for short.

A work-in-progress fansite for Arknights where you can listen/read operator's voice records and switch easily between languages.

I'm learning Chinese and Japanese and I am hopelessly in love with web design and development so I'm willing to waste whole weekends for this apparently.

## Bugs to squash
- Nine-colored Deer (and other crossover characters) puts CV data in different place, so they're not shown here. Fix that.
- Xiaohei only have the cat noise, not the human form voice. Low-priority, but might be worth a look

# Things to do
- Add rarity and class filter to list page
- Lazy loading on list page (low prio but still)
- Make 404 page
- Make desktop style
- Write credits and front page
- Clean up scripts and write doc
- Build and host somewhere (probably github pages)
- Release to the wild
- Sleep
