# Rhodes Island Tetralingual Voice Record Database
Or just TLVR for short.

A work-in-progress fansite for Arknights where you can listen/read operator's voice records and switch easily between languages.

I'm learning Chinese and Japanese and I am hopelessly in love with web design and development so I'm willing to waste whole weekends for this apparently.
