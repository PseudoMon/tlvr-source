# Rhodes Island Tetralingual Voice Record Database
Or just TLVR for short.

A work-in-progress fansite for Arknights where you can listen/read operator's voice records and switch easily between languages.

I'm learning Chinese and Japanese and I am hopelessly in love with web design and development so I'm willing to waste whole weekends for this apparently.

## Bugs to squash
- Photocard looks kinda ugly when stretched
- Text in photocard overflow when it's multiple line
- Generally do something about the photocard, yeah?
- Nine-colored Deer (and probably other crossover characters) puts CV data somewhere else. Fix that.
- Xiaohei only have the cat noise, not the human form voice. Low-priority, but might be worth a look

# Things to do
- Get all the data here
- Make the list page (+ lazy loading)
- Make 404 page
- Squash image size (webp is fine, use ffmpeg)
- Make desktop style
- Write credits and front page
- Clean up scripts and write doc
- Build and host somewhere (probably github pages)
- Release to the wild
- Sleep
